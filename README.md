# T20 World Cup Data Analysis

This project uses T20 World Cup data to perform comprehensive analysis using Power BI. The data is initially in JSON format, converted to CSVs, preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency, and finally visualized in Power BI.

## Project Structure

- `cricket_data_analysis.pbix`: Main Power BI file containing the visualizations.
- `data/`: Directory containing the preprocessed CSV files.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.
3. Open the `cricket_data_analysis.pbix` file with Power BI Desktop.
4. Explore the data visualizations presented in the report.

## Data Processing

The data was obtained in JSON format, which was then converted to CSV for easier processing in Power BI. The preprocessing steps included cleaning the data, handling missing values, and creating new computed columns to enhance the analysis.

## Visualizations

The Power BI report includes several visualizations such as:
- Total runs scored by each team
- Top players of the tournament
- Match summary statistics
- Interactive charts for performance analysis over different phases of the games
